# The `fixdif` Package

The `fixdif` package provides an interface for defining the style of differential operators.

The basic commands are:

- `\d`: for differential operator "d" in math mode and under-dot accent in text;
- `\partial`: a "fixed" partial differential operator command;
- `\letdif`: an interface for defining new commands for differential operators.

See `fixdif.pdf` for more. Happy TeXing!
